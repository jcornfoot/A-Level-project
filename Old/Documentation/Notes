Pick the correct project
It has to be "complex enough" and not overly advanced 
It needs to be something I have an interest in so I wont find it boring

Ensure good documentation exactly to the criteria and no more than 100 pages long
Only link evidence where needed and get rid of repetition
Examiners only look at the important parts of the work

So stick to marking criteria and follow the specification

15 pages analysis
25 pages design
40 pages development
30 pages evaluation

advised against going over the recomended 100 page limit


Focus on the development and programming part of the project
Reference code from online sources, comment and include a link to all additions
