website
build an host a web server
"client wants to run their own web server to monitor the stats of their server, docker container"
PROBLEMS: not being able to see resource usage from the container, secure login to the website, setting up a self signed certificate and htt---------------------------------------ps
STAKEHOLDERS:

login database
securely store and hash users passwords in the style of /etc/shadow
"a client needs to securely store employee and customer login details with an account creation interface and SQL backend including SQL injection resistance and salting of passwords with strong encryption"
PROBLEMS: sql injection resistance, hashing and salt implementation, secure storage of user information
STAKEHOLDERS:


port scanner
-give it an ip addres and it scans the top 1000 ports or specific ports 
run i on a local ip and search simply for open ports and services
"A client wants to test the machines on their network to look for open and vulnerable services to secure"
PROBLEMS: accessing the network, correctly scanning and identifying ports 



game
-could use a minimax algorithm
-rogue like 
-2D top down base defence game
-turnbased 
-leaderboard
--login system
--retained scores
--account creation and deletion
-profiles on players to help predict their next move and change affinity value on squares
-alpha beta pruning to cut down on computation



game server
Fully program a containerised game server that scales with game load
"a client wants to host a server for their game, it needs to be able to support several players simultaneously and automatically change scale to load balance eg containerised app"
PROBLEMS:finding or building a simple game to test with eg multiplayer or single player, load balancing, user simulation for testing, resource monitoring


password cracker
input an unsalted hash and run it against rainbow tables and rockyou.txt returning the correct password
multicore utilisation for GPU
time estimate upper bound not maximum time
"a client wants to test the strengths of their users passwords by running them



physics simulation



audit tool



encryption tool



ssh application
