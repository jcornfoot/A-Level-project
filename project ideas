website
build an host a web server
"client wants to run their own web server to monitor the stats of their server, docker container"
PROBLEMS: not being able to see resource usage from the container, secure login to the website, setting up a self signed certificate and htt---------------------------------------ps
STAKEHOLDERS:

login database
securely store and hash users passwords in the style of /etc/shadow
"a client needs to securely store employee and customer login details with an account creation interface and SQL backend including SQL injection resistance and salting of passwords with strong encryption"
PROBLEMS: sql injection resistance, hashing and salt implementation, secure storage of user information
STAKEHOLDERS:


port scanner
-give it an ip addres and it scans the top 1000 ports or specific ports 
run i on a local ip and search simply for open ports and services
"A client wants to test the machines on their network to look for open and vulnerable services to secure"
PROBLEMS: accessing the network, correctly scanning and identifying ports 



game
-could use a minimax algorithm
-rogue like 
-2D top down base defence game
-turnbased 
-leaderboard
--login system
--retained scores
--account creation and deletion
-profiles on players to help predict their next move and change affinity value on squares
-alpha beta pruning to cut down on computation




game server
Fully program a containerised game server that scales with game load
"a client wants to host a server for their game, it needs to be able to support several players simultaneously and automatically change scale to load balance eg containerised app"
PROBLEMS:finding or building a simple game to test with eg multiplayer or single player, load balancing, user simulation for testing, resource monitoring





physics simulation

GAME alt
-A fast paced, roguelike, 2d platformer shooter with a similar style and concepts to superfighters, my firend pedro, ultrakill, celeste or other games of that genre
-retro sounding 8-bit style of music or a more futurey, synth style of sound design, like cyberpunk 
-movement tech
-fluidity
-simplicity of the interface, the camera will exist as a square on a larger simulated area, the whole area will be simulated at the same time 
but will allow player tracking and zoom functions for the player, the camera region will fit the size of the window and can be achieved by first 
rendering the whole level and then drawing the camera borders on screen and hiding the rest from the user by zooming to the boarderless camera region
-bullets and weapons should be simple sprites that have sufficient collision properties and can interract with weapons or other objects in the game for e.g. blocking/cover damage
-NPC's should be able to accurately target the player and take cover, behind objects. NPC's should also use some of the same movement tech and gadgets as 
the payer depending on their difficulty or enemy type, with characters throwing grenades, using shields to block, and hiding from the players current attack by dodging or blocking.
-enemy types
-cover
-Environmental objects. The levl should have several interactable objects that the player (or NPCs) can utilise, like glass, falling objects, exploding barrels and doors
-music should fit the current chaos of the onging battle, with it ramping up as combat intensifies while stil being a good fit for the current action 
like doom, ultrakill or cuberpunk2077
