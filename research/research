Music

There ar eseveral ideas when it comes to ingame music:

looped soundtrack:
pros: easy to implement, fewer songs need to be developed, nothing fancy has to be done to the track to make it work
cons: boring, song stays the same despite what is happening in game, less appealing unless the game is constantly fast paced and the gameplay will always fit the music

Level triggers:
pros: music fits the game better, ability to fine tune soundtrack to fit in with gameplay
cons: Triggers have to be added to the level and greatly increase complexity of level design, syncing soundtrack will be difficult
